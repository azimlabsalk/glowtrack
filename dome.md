# Dome

A geodesic dome was used as a frame onto which cameras and lights were attached, and was constructed from a combination of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts.

A geodesic dome shape was selected rather than a rectilinear system in order to facilitate placing all cameras and lights at the same distance from the target.

## Components

- 30 x length 4.5" aluminum rod, 1/4" diameter
- 35 x length 5.3" aluminum rod, 1/4" diameter

- 20 x hexagonal hubs, 3D-printed
- 6 x pentagonal hubs, 3D-printed
- 130 x rod end-connector, 3D-printed (epoxied onto rods)

- 5 x 12-LED holder, 3D-printed
- 4 x 6-LED, 3D-printed

- 130 x M3 machine screw and nut (connects one end-connector to a hub)
- 9 x 1/4" machine screw and nut (connects one hub to one LED module) 

- 1 x J-B Weld 50176 KwikWeld Steel Reinforced Epoxy Syringe

## 3D-printing

The hubs and rod end-connectors were printed in FormLabs Tough Resin because they are load-bearing. The LED holder were printed in FormLabs Clear Resin.
